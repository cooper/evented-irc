# Async.pm: IO::Async::Protocol for libirc socket. |
#---------------------------------------------------
package IRC::Async;

# IO::Async---
# | This class inherits from IRC and IO::Async::Protocol::LineStream. it can be used,
# | with the IO::Async framework simply by ->add'ing it to an IO::Async::Loop and then
# | calling $irc->connect. You do not have to create a socket manually.
# ------------

# clarity-----
# | IRC.pm and Core/Async/IRC.pm are a bit confusing.
# | IRC.pm is the base of the actual IRC class/instance.
# | Core::Async::IRC is based on IRC.pm for asynchronous connections.
# | all IRC objects in ntirc should be objects of Core::Async::IRC,
# | which inherits the methods of IRC.pm.
# ------------

# events------
# | libirc (IRC.pm) is all about events.
# | IO::Async::Notifier (a base of this class) is all about events too.
# | libirc events fired with fire_event; Notifier events are fired with invoke_event.
# | the only Notifier event that ntirc visibly uses here is the on_error event,
# | which may be passed to new().
# ------------
